Around 700 years ago, during a period of intense volcanic activity known as the ‘Crimson Tears,’ the earth began to weep obsidian – not the glassy, polished kind, but a dense, almost sentient material that pulsed with faint light. This obsidian was found only within the heart of the Volcanic Peaks, and it seemed to react to sound, particularly complex harmonic sequences.  The first recorded attempts at harnessing this phenomenon were made by the ‘Silversmiths’ of Solara – artisans who specialized in manipulating light and sonic resonance. They developed a series of resonators crafted from polished moonstone and intricately carved bone, using them to trigger patterns within the obsidian. ",
